# 📊 Statistics for Data Science – Foundations

This document contains my learning notes on **Foundational Statistics for Data Science**.  
It covers the essential terms, types, and concepts that serve as the base for advanced ML and AI topics.

## 1️⃣ What is Statistics?

Statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with:
- **Collecting**
- **Organizing**
- **Analyzing**
- **Interpreting**
- **Presenting** data.

👉 In **Data Science**, statistics helps us make sense of data and extract insights.

## 2️⃣ Key Terms

- **Data** → Collection of information (numbers, words, observations, measurements).  
- **Variable** → A characteristic or attribute that can take different values.  

### Types of Variables
- **Quantitative (Numerical):** Represent numeric values.  
  - Examples: age, salary, height.  
- **Qualitative (Categorical):** Represent categories or labels.  
  - Examples: gender, blood group, product type.

- **Population** → Entire group we want to study.  
- **Sample** → Subset of the population used for study.  
- **Parameter** → Numerical value that describes a population.  
- **Statistic** → Numerical value that describes a sample.

## 3️⃣ Branches of Statistics

1. **Descriptive Statistics** → Summarizing and describing data.  
   - **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, Mode  
   - **Measures of Variability**: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  
   - **Graphical Representation**: Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Boxplots  

2. **Inferential Statistics** → Making predictions and generalizations about a population based on a sample.  
   - Probability Distributions  
   - Hypothesis Testing  
   - Regression Analysis  
   - Confidence Intervals

## 4️⃣ Types of Data

### 1. **Qualitative Data (Categorical)**
- **Nominal Data** → Categories without order.  
  *Example: gender, colors, types of fruit.*  
- **Ordinal Data** → Categories with meaningful order, but differences between values are not measurable.  
  *Example: ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd), satisfaction levels (low, medium, high).*

### 2. **Quantitative Data (Numerical)**
- **Discrete Data** → Countable values, no fractions allowed.  
  *Example: number of students, goals scored.*  
- **Continuous Data** → Measurable values, can take any real number.  
  *Example: weight, height, time.*

## 5️⃣ Levels of Measurement

1. **Nominal** → Categories with no order.  
   - Example: blood group (A, B, AB, O).  

2. **Ordinal** → Categories with order but unequal intervals.  
   - Example: survey responses (Agree, Neutral, Disagree).  

3. **Interval** → Ordered, equal intervals, but no true zero.  
   - Example: temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit.  

4. **Ratio** → Ordered, equal intervals, true zero exists.  
   - Example: height, weight, salary.

| **Parameter**           | Value describing population                     | Average age of school      |
| **Statistic**           | Value describing sample                         | Average age of 50 students |
| **Descriptive Stats**   | Summarize & describe data                       | Mean, Median, Charts       |
| **Inferential Stats**   | Predict/infer about population                   | Hypothesis testing         |
| **Nominal**             | Categories without order                        | Colors, Blood type         |
| **Ordinal**             | Categories with order, no equal gaps            | Rankings, Satisfaction     |
| **Interval**            | Ordered, equal gaps, no true zero               | Temperature (°C)           |
| **Ratio**               | Ordered, equal gaps, true zero                  | Height, Weight, Salary     |
